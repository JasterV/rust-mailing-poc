# rust-mailing-poc

## TODO

- [ ] Use env_logger (just for fun actually)
- [ ] Implement email_receiver as a web server that exposes multiple endpoints to play around with IMAP commands
- [ ] Add a Makefile with commands to make it easier to test both sender and receiver
- [ ] Document both sender and receiver APIs (just to make this POC more friendly)
